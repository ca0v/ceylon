# Ceylon

**This library is currently in development and should not be used (yet)**

Ceylon is an assertion library for unit testing written in Typescript.

It is based upon the API for [expect](https://github.com/mjackson/expect/), with the added bonus of full Typescript definitions, meaning there's no need to go looking for a d.ts file.

Ceylon aims to simplify unit testing in Typescript by making it easy to write assertions.

## Installation

Using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ceylon):

```
npm install --save ceylon
```

Then import into your Typescript code like so:

```typescript
import expect from 'ceylon';
```

There is no need to reference a Typescript definition file as the source code for Ceylon is all written in Typescript.
